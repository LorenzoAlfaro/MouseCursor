# MouseCursor


## Introduction

## Functionality

**Avoid hitting the select all army button.**

Why you need this? Even if you disable the hotkey there is a way a button embedded in the GUI. This cannot be disable.
So even I had disabled the hotkey I found myself just moving the cursor to click on the button. I couldn't stop this bad habit. Hence this functionality.

Now I play games were I consistantly assigned my units to control groups. And if I panic and try to select my whole army, I just can't. Which reinforces
my muscle memory to bind units to control groups.

**Auto unselect units.**

This one is more polemic and I it does have the power to do inhuman splits. Useful agaisnt splash damage.

WARNING. Using this script may count as cheating as it is assisting you and that could count as an unfair advantage.

INSERT PICTURE.

But in the end what is doing it automating a very tedious and prone to error process that you do in every RTS game.

You have a group of unit selected. You command the whole group to go to a corner of the map to scout. You go back to your
group selection and (shift + click) unselect a unit. Then issue an overriding command to the rest of the army to stay put.

This has the total effect of sending a single unit to scout. Which is now unbinded to the control group and now will stay there.
Except of course if you are an F2 abuser (hence the first functionality)

You perform this mechanic or variations of it multiple times over a single game. I have multiple times fail by a few pixels and the unselection did not happen.

## Future state

I hope new RTS just include this functionality by default.
